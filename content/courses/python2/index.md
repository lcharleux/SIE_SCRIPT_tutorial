## Introduction

Already comfortable with the basics from block 3 ? In Part 2 (Advanced), we go beyond syntax and focus on writing reliable, reusable code for real research projects.

What you’ll learn in Part 2 (Advanced):

- Organizing code with functions, classes, modules, and simple packaging
- Using virtual environments and dependency management for reproducibility
- Working effectively with Jupyter/Marimo notebooks (structure, pitfalls, exports)
- Data wrangling with pandas/polars and scientific workflows with SciPy
- Plotting at scale and saving publication‑ready figures
- Share devcontainer setups for consistent environments across team members
- Time will be spent answering your specific questions and applying concepts to your research

By the end, you’ll have a robust, efficient workflow that scales from exploratory notebooks to reusable research code.
