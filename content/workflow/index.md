This modular training series supports doctoral researchers in developing core competencies for rigorous, efficient, and reproducible research workflows. The modules integrate scholarly writing (LaTeX), version control (Git), scientific programming (Python), and reproducible execution environments (Docker). Participants may complete the full sequence or select modules aligned with their research needs.

Recommended sequence

- Block 1: [LaTeX]({{< relref "courses/latex/index.md" >}})
- Block 2: [Git]({{< relref "courses/git/index.md" >}})
- Block 3: [Python 1/2]({{< relref "courses/python1/index.md" >}})
- Block 4: [Docker]({{< relref "courses/docker/index.md" >}})
- Block 5: [Python 2/2]({{< relref "courses/python2/index.md" >}})

Participants may enroll in any subset of modules. The above progression is recommended for coherence; Python 2/2 assumes familiarity with the material from Python 1/2.
